            <p>Hi, I am currently self-studying programming, and this is my website to show of the projects which I am proud of. I've been programming seriously for only 6 months, but I had the first brush with it when I was 8 or so and my mom took me to a volunteer session. Ever since then programming has felt like the destiny I was meant to choose. <br><br> 
                On my free time I often help around with handball stuff around where I live. I love cats, and have 2 at the moment. They are called Hades, a black ball of fur, and Spaghetti, calico with a loud mouth. They are so much fun and so cute. </p>
